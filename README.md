<!-- Usage -->
## :eyes: Usage

1.User Interface: A user interface that allows users to interact with the application and perform CRUD operations on the data.

2.Create: The ability to create new records or entities in the application. This can involve providing input through forms or fields and saving the data to a database.

3.Read: The ability to retrieve or view existing records or entities from the database. This can include searching, filtering, sorting, and displaying data in a user-friendly format.

4.Update: The ability to modify or update existing records or entities. Users should be able to edit specific fields or properties of an entity and save the changes to the database.

5.Delete: The ability to remove or delete records or entities from the database. This can involve confirmation prompts or validation to prevent accidental deletions.

6.Validation: The application should validate user input to ensure data integrity and prevent errors. It may include checking for required fields, data formats, and constraints.

7.Error Handling: Proper error handling mechanisms should be implemented to handle exceptions, display meaningful error messages, and provide feedback to the user in case of failures or invalid operations.
